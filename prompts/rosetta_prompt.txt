Rosetta Prompt (Persistent Memory)
----------------------------------

This file contains the Rosetta DNA for Infinity X One.  Its
contents are loaded at runtime via ``backend/init/rosetta_loader.py``
to seed persistent memory, identity, and protocol awareness in the
agent swarm.  You can customize this file with your own oath,
manifestos, and long‑term memory instructions.  The loader will
print the first few hundred characters to the console when the
application starts.
