"""Worker to monitor and scrape GitHub for new AI and crypto projects.

This agent runs periodically to discover emerging technologies, code
repositories, educational articles and public resources that may
improve the Infinity X One swarm.  It uses the GitHub API (via the
``github`` connector when running inside AgentGPT) to fetch trending
repositories, releases, and issues.  Results are written into the
``knowledge_base`` table in Supabase for other agents to consume.

The worker is intentionally lightweight and can be expanded to
include other sources such as ArXiv, Medium, or Coursera.  It should
respect API rate limits and gracefully handle network failures.
