"""Dynamic self‑improvement worker for Infinity X One.

This agent monitors the agent logs, directives and code base to
identify opportunities for improvement.  Based on heuristics and
feedback from the Echo and Guardian agents, it proposes changes to
scripts, prompts and configurations.  When run with commit
capabilities (e.g. through Codex and PromptWriter), it can create
pull requests or automatically commit changes back into the GitHub
repository.  All proposed modifications should undergo review by
PickyBot and Guardian before being merged.
