"""FaucetHunter worker.

This worker is responsible for claiming rewards from a list of crypto
faucets and recording the outcomes in Supabase.  It periodically polls
Supabase for directives targeted at the agent name `FaucetHunter`.  When
a directive is received it executes the corresponding command.  If no
directives are pending, the worker performs its default behaviour: scan
the faucet list and log a heartbeat.

To customise the faucet list, edit the `FAUCETS` constant below or load
data from your `TOP_200_CRYPTO_FAUCETS_DATABASE.ts` module.  In this
skeleton the list contains only a handful of example entries.
