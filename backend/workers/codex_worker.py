"""Codex worker.

Codex is the system builder and technical architect.  It can generate
code, synthesise deployment manifests and push changes to GitHub.  In
this stub implementation, Codex logs tasks to Supabase and triggers
other workers as needed.  Extend this module to call language models
such as OpenAI Codex or GPT‑4 for actual code synthesis.
