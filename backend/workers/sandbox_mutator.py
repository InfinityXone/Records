"""Sandbox mutation worker for experimenting with agent strategies.

This agent runs clones of strategies in isolation, evaluates their
performance and reports back to the hive.  It is designed to safely
test new algorithms, faucet strategies or trading heuristics without
impacting production.  Results are written into the ``mutation_log``
table along with performance metrics.
