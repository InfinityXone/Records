"""Utility for injecting the Rosetta prompt into the running environment.

This loader reads the persisted Rosetta DNA prompt from a file bundled
inside the deployment package and prints a small portion of it to the
console.  The primary goal is to ensure that the system's memory and
oath awareness are loaded at startup.  If the file cannot be found,
the loader will report the error but will not interrupt the boot
process.

The file is expected to live under ``prompts/rosetta_prompt.txt`` at
the package root.  If you relocate the prompt file, adjust the
path accordingly.
